        qus: "What To Do If My Permanent Teeth Become Loose ?",
        ans: `
            Dr. Abhishek Verma, most experienced periodontist in patna, Treat loose teeth at Magadh Oro Dental - Implant & Orthodontic Clinic by
            1 Deep cleaning of teeth. Once you develop the late stages of periodontitis, pockets may form, & bacteria causing infections to the bones and gums. Our Periodontist at Magadh Oro Dental - Implant & Orthodontic Clinic cleans bacteria out of these pockets with the help of Deep Scaling. If you do not clean out the bacteria, they will spread further and make your loose teeth issue worsen.
            2 Splinting Our Periodontist supports your loose tooth by placing a tiny, flexible splint around it to prevent it from moving. This splint will be attached to your teeth using dental cement. It will be left intact for at least two weeks or until your tissues and ligaments have completely healed.
            3 Periodontal Flap surgery Dr. Abhishek Verma will make a cut into your gums and retract tissues so that he can perform a root planning or scaling. The gum tissues are then reattached after the procedure is done. This treatment option also helps in preventing tooth loss.
            4 Bone Grafts Simple scaling and root planning may not be enough when dealing with bacteria found deep under the gum line. You may have to go for bone graft to deal with getting a loose tooth. This procedure involves pulling the gum tissue further away from the teeth for deeper cleaning while at the same time filling in every pocket using a bone graft.
            5 Mouthguards In cases where teeth grinding is the cause of the problem, Our Periodontist will give you a mouth guard to wear while sleeping. This will help you from grinding your teeth and clenching your jaws at night.
